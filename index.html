    <!--Should build temp divs so Julia can build the frames in html / css
    In order to not have really shitty JS onclick methods where you turn off the display for every other
        frame, we should build the frames in JS and clear it when you toggle
            - Is there a way to clear?
                If not, could build a function that goes through all children of the frame (div) and empties them or something
    The frames built in HTML- Ren can rebuild them in JS-->
